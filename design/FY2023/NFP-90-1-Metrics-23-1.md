**Digital Alchemy - Richard See & Brijendra Pratap Singh**

**Revisions**
-   New Feature Proposal -- 25-November-2022
-   New Feature Design -- (original) 06-December-22 (updated) 08-December-2022, 14-December-2022, 24-Jan-2023

## Justification for New Feature
Many new metrics appear in the ASHRAE 90.1-2019 \[1\] standard.
EnergyPlus should be updated to stay in-sync with these new metrics.

## Overview
We have identified and investigated the following commonly used
equipment metrics, defined by various industry organizations and used in
ASHRAE 90.1-2019:

In a previous Task Order, we implemented support for calculation and reporting of SEER2 and HSPF2.  This was done for SingleSpeed, TwoSpeed, MultiSpeed Cooling and Heating coils.  It was also done for CurveFit: Speed Cooling coils.
In this Task Order we propose to implement support for calculation and reporting of the 2022 version of the AHRI IEER metric.  If budget allows, we will also extend the range of coils reporting SEER2 and HSPF2 to include VariableSpeed Cool and heating Coils.

## IEER = Integrated Energy Efficiency Rating (2022)
The Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) will be calculated and reported as defined in the 2022 version of the AHRI 340/360 standard -- "Performance Rating of Commercial and Industrial Unitary Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Equipment." This metric will be calculated and reported for Air-cooled Unitary Air-conditioners and Unitary Heat Pumps with capacities greater than 65,000 Btu/h.  When compared to the previous (limited) implementation of the 2008 version of this standard, the Temperature time bins have changed and various test conditions for calculation of this metric have have changed & been expanded.
<br/><br/>
**General IEER Equations** <br/>
For units covered by this standard, the IEER shall be calculated using test derived 
data and the below Equation<br/><br/>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78803858/205349295-b53d2fe9-c227-49a6-b926-fe00737e3b8c.png)<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Where:<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;**A** = EER, (Btu/h)/W, at 100% Capacity at AHRI Standard Rating Conditions (see Table 6)<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;**B** = EER, (Btu/h)/W, at 75% Capacity and reduced condenser temperature (see Table 9)<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;**C** = EER, (Btu/h)/W, at 50% Capacity and reduced condenser temperature (see Table 9)<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;**D** = EER, (Btu/h)/W, at 25% Capacity and reduced condenser temperature (see Table 9)<br/>
<br/>
The IEER rating requires that the unit efficiency be determined at 100, 75, 50, and 25 Percent Load at the 
conditions specified in Table 9 and at the part-load rated indoor airflow, if different than the Full Load Rated Indoor Airflow. <br/>

The degradation coefficient, to account for cycling of the compressor for capacity less than the 
minimum step of capacity, shall be calculated using the Equation below:<br/>

## SEER2 = Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (2023)
Currently, there is at least one DX cooling coil for which SEER2 is not calculated & reported. We proposal to extend SEER2 calculation and reporting to include Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed. Calculation of the SEER2 value for these Variable Speed coils will be according to the following - extracted from the AHRI 340/360-2022 standard:<br/>

## HSPF2 = Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (2023)
Currently, there is at least one DX cooling coils for which HSPF2 is not calculated. We proposal to extend HSPF2 calculation and reporting to include Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed.

## Approach
For each metric, we will first identify a set of EnergyPlus components to which the metric applies. We will then locate sample files that contain these object types -- to be used in testing. Coils we currently belive will be included are shown in the outline below.

For IEER, we will update code written in 2010, which calculated IEER for one coil type (Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed), based on the 2008 version of AHRI 340/360. We will update this code and expand generation of this metric to many other coil types.  This update will ensure that calculations are consistent with the newest version of this rating = the 2022 version of AHRI 340/360. The new code will include support for the updated Time Bins and expanded test conditions. We will also update existing unit tests and add more unit tests to verify IEER calculation and reporting for several new coil types.

If the time budget for this SOW allows, we will also extend support for calculation of SEER2 and HSPF2 for the variable speed DX coil variants, that could not be completed in the 22-2 development cycle. As before, this will require adding new fields to these coils -- that will enable users to specify the 'Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate {W/(m3/s)}' inputs -- used in calculating the SEER2 & HSPF2 values. 

Once the metrics are calculated we can integrate them into the corresponding report code of the equipment summary table.

This will all be done by extending the implementation in StandardRatings.hh & StandardRatings.cc.  Our initial estimate for the scope of this work includes the following:
-   For IEER
    -   SingleSpeedDXCoolingCoilStandardRatings -- used for the following E+ coils:
        -   Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed
        -   Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit
        -   Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit (single-speed operating mode)

    -   MultiSpeedDXCoolingCoilStandardRatings -- used for the following E+ coils:
        -   Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed
        -   Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed *(Note: standard formula/test conditions are limited to 4 speeds)*
        -   Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit
        -   Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit (multi-speed operating mode)

    -   Extend ReportDXCoilRating to report metrics for all the coils listed above.
    -   CheckCurveLimitsForStandardRatings
    -   Ensure existing unit tests pass with changes
    -   Add new tests where new cases have been added

-   For SEER2
    -   MultiSpeedDXCoolingCoilStandardRatings -- add support for:
        -   Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
    -   Update existing unit tests and add new tests where new cases have been added

-   For HSPF2
    -   MultiSpeedDXHeatingCoilStandardRatings -- add support for:
        -   Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed
    -   Ensuer existing unit tests pass with changes 
    -   Add new tests where new cases have been added

## Testing/Validation/Data Source(s)
Example files will be simulated to confirm calculation and reporting of the these metrics. Simulation results will be compared with values generated by a third-party implementation (assuming we can locate one).  Peer reviewer input on this is eagerly invited.
Unit tests for the Continuous Integration pipeline will also be updated/extended to confirm the calculation of the metrics and ensure the code produces correct results and does not fail when future code changes are merged.

## Input Output Reference Documentation
The Input Output Documentation will be expanded to include the new metrics. There will be an update in two places: first on the related section of the EnergyPlus components for which the metric is calculated and second in the reports section, specifically the Equipment Summary report. We will also add a disclaimer: \"It is not reasonable to expect AHRI ratings calculated from model inputs to match the actual ratings in the AHRI directory. This is largely because it is common practice for manufacturers to underrate their equipment for marketing reasons and/or to build in some safety margin in case DOE audits their ratings.\"

## Input Description
New fields will be added to the variable speed DX coils (both cooling and heating) to represent the static pressure on the fans (Power per flow rate).

## Outputs Description
There will be an update to the reports to include the metrics as described above.

## Engineering Reference
The Engineering Reference will be updated with a high-level description
of the calculations with links/references to Formulae (by number)
defined in the standards. formulas used to calculate the two metrics and
be referenced from the corresponding EnergyPlus components.

## Example Files and Transition Changes
Transition rules will be required to accommodate the new fields added to the VariableSpeed DX coils.
Example files that include the VariableSpeed DX coils will need to be updated.

-   For IEER: There are 225 example files that feature one or more of various DX coils listed above.  Testing will be done for some or all of these.  We will begin with one example for each of: SingleSpeed, TwoSpeed, MultiSpeed, VariableSpeed, and CurveFit:Speed.  For example:
    -   HeatPump.idf								                 – Single speed cooling (Condenser:EvapCooled)
    -   HeatPumpAuto.idf                     – Single speed cooling & heating (Condenser:AirCooled)
    -   RetailPackagedTESCoil.idf					       – Single speed cooling/thermalStorage (Condenser:EvapCooled)
    -   UnitarySystem_SingleSpeedDX.idf		    – Single speed CurveFit (Condenser:EvapCooled)
    -   5ZoneAutoDXVAV.idf					              – Two speed cooling (Condenser:EvapCooled)
    -   MultiSpeedHeatPump.idf				           – Mulitspeed cooling & heating (Condenser:AirCooled)
    -   PackagedTerminalHeatPumpVSAS.idf	    – Variable speed cooling & heating (Condenser:AirCooled)
    -   UnitarySystem_MultiSpeedDX			        – Mulitspeed cooling CurveFit (Condenser:AirCooled)
    -   HeatPumpWaterToAirEquationFit.idf 			– WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit	 (Condenser:WaterCooled)
    -   VSHeatPumpWaterToAirEquationFit.idf		– WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit (Condenser:WaterCooled)

-   For SEER2/HSPF2: There are 11 example files that feature one or both of the variable speed DX coils.  Testing will be done with some of all of these.  We will start files which include variable speed DX coils for both heating and cooling.  For example:
    -   PackagedTerminalAirConditionerVSAS.idf	– Variable speed cooling & heating
    -   PackagedTerminalHeatPumpVSAS.idf		     – Variable speed cooling & heating

## E-mail and Conference Call Conclusions ##
Comments from Technicalities call on 14-Dec-22:
-   Neal Kruis:
    -   Will your calculations take into consideration the physical configuration of the coils -- i.e. in-building, rooftop, others?
    -   Not saying this is required, but am curious.
        -   This won't be possible in this cycle, but could be considered as an enhancement in the future.
-   Mike Witte:
    -   Caution against trying to make assumptions about the configuration of coils in EnergyPlus, 
        because they are analytical models rather that exact representations of manufactured equipment.
        -   Understood.
-   Richard Roustad:
    -   Might want to consider a user input field -- requesting that metrics be calculated and reported 
        for that instance of the coil.
        -   Interesting idea.  By default, these metrics will be calculated for all supported coil types. 
-   Jason Glazer:
    -   Will these be calculated and reported for the special coils that are specifically for Data Centers?
        -   This is a good idea!
        -   Unfortunately, our plates are really full with the 10 coil types already listed. Maybe a future expansion?
    -   You mentioned that some calculations are being done according to the 2023 version of an AHRI standard
        Originally, the intent in calculating these metrics was to use the versions referenced by ASHRAE 90.1
        -   We compared the 2022 version with the 2018 version and found only a few limited differences.
        -   It seems reasonable to expect that the 2022 version of 90.1 will update to the 2023 version of AHRI 21-/240
-   Tianzhen Hong:
    -   Suggestion that reporting of the metrics should be very clear about what version of the standard was used 
        to do the calculations.
        -   Yes, we are making the clear in footnotes to the report tables.
